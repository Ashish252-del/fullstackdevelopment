// Localhost is the hostname or the computer that is currently in use to run a program,
//in which the computer has the role as a virtual server.In web development,
//     you can develop a server by editing the code in the localhost and exporting your data to the server.
// The loopback address has a default IP(127.0.0.1) useful to test programs on your computer,
//     without sending information over the internet.This helps when you are testing applications that arenâ€™t ready for the world to see.
// When you call an IP address from your computer,
//     you usually try to contact a different computer over the internet.However,
//      with the loopback address, you are calling the localhost, aka your computer.

// .listen is use to run the server and first parameter is port no
// where server will run and second is local host here IP 127.0.0.1 is equivalent 
// to local host
server.listen(3000, "127.0.0.1", () => {
    console.log("server is running at port no 3000")
});//

// to check the response of the server write in browser
// you can also check these url in postman
// http://localhost:3000/
 //http://localhost:3000/contact
 //http://localhost:3000/about
 //http://localhost:3000/profile
